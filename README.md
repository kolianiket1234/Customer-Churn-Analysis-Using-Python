# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Using-Python
## Project Objectives
Customer churn occurs when an existing customer stops doing business with a company. This project aims to analyze customer churn, identify key factors contributing to churn, and develop predictive models to help businesses retain customers.

#Dataset
The dataset includes the following information:

Customer demographics: Age, gender, location, etc.
Subscription/transaction history: Purchase frequency, last purchase date, etc.
Customer engagement metrics: Support interactions, activity levels, etc.
Churn indicator: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

#Project Workflow

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Load the dataset (CSV, SQL, or API).
Handle missing values and duplicates.
Perform data cleaning and transformation.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize customer behavior and churn trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analyze correlations between features.
Identify high-risk customer segments.

3. Feature Engineering

Create new features such as tenure length, last purchase date, and engagement level.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. Insights & Recommendations

Identify major churn factors (e.g., low engagement, pricing issues, poor service).
Suggest strategies for retention, such as personalized offers and better customer service.
Implement proactive measures to reduce churn rates.

#Outcome

âœ” A data-driven approach to understanding customer churn.
âœ” Actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
âœ” A dashboard for visualizing key churn trends.

#Technologies Used

ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ”¹ Data Processing (Pandas, NumPy)
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Power BI)

#Conclusion

Customer churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers leave and take action to retain them. This project uses data exploration and visualization to identify key churn factors like low engagement and pricing issues. By analyzing patterns and using interactive dashboards, businesses can monitor churn trends and improve customer retention.
